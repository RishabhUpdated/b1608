This project contains my research progress from the COSMOS summer program. I estimated the distance to the celestial object B1608+656 by measuring gravitational lensing-induced time delays. Implented custom interpolation and chi-squared fitting algorithms to calcuate time delays. Characterized target using time delays and gravlens modeling tool.
